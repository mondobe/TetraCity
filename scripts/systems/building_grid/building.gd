## Controls buildings that have been placed on the grid.
## For rotation details, see: https://tetris.wiki/Super_Rotation_System

## Options for a building's center of rotation.
## For example, T-blocks have the center of rotation in the middle of a block,
## while I-blocks have it in the corner of two blocks.

## Options for a building's kick mode (basically, whether it looks more like
## a T-block or an I-block)
enum KickMode { NORMAL, LONG }

## The blueprint on which this building was based.
var blueprint: BuildingBlueprint

## The blueprint variation this building uses (containing alternate sprite information).

## The building's grid of pixels. The size is equal to the bounding box size,
## and the grid is filled with a 1 (if there is a pixel) or 0 (if there isn't).
